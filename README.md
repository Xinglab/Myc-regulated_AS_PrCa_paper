# Myc-regulated alternative splicing events in aggressive prostate cancer  
Scripts for plotting figures and running analysis throughout the manuscript

Folders or files of scripts are named following this format: 'figure index'.'plot/analysis name'

### Notes
1. Customized scripts are hard-coded for specific analysis or plots.
2. For similar type of figure/analysis, only show one script as an example.
3. Scatter plots of pathway-AS correlation are generated by [PEGASAS pipeline](https://github.com/Xinglab/PEGASAS)(https://github.com/Xinglab/PEGASAS)
4. Sashimi plots are generated by [rmats2sashimiplot](https://github.com/Xinglab/rmats2sashimiplot)(https://github.com/Xinglab/rmats2sashimiplot)
